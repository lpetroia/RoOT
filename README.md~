# RoOT
<<<<<<< HEAD
VillageReach and the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department at the University of Washington developed an Excel-based distribution routing tool, called Route Optimization Tool (RoOT), that optimizes routing for distribution of vaccines and medical supplies. RoOT input data is easily modified, and considers the availability of roads, vehicles, and medical products to distribute. The tool can be used for routine operations, in emergency situations, or to evaluate the effect of changes in the situation (such as new or closed health centers, additional or fewer vehicles, new products, or new refrigerators).
